	<h3> Our Mission </h3>
	<p> Morning Grind was openened in July 2018 by two former coffee addicts. Our mission was developed with the intent to provide San Franciscans with a relaxing location to enjoy a great cup of coffee. </p>

	<h3> Location </h3>
	<p> We are located in the heart of San Francsico, near Golden Gate Park. We chose our location with the idea that our cafe should be accessible for anyone, from business-people to college students. </p>
